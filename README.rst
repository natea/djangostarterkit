The Django Starter Kit project was started at the DjangoCon 2011 sprints in Portland, OR. We want to identify the stumbling blocks, points of confusion and friction when trying to learn Django.

The goal of the Django Starter Kit is to collect useful resources, and provide a concise guide to getting started with Django, including a one-click installer of Django for quickly setting up a local development environment.
